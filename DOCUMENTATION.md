## Recent Changes

- [2026-04-27 12:15]: **Meticulous Global Accent Color Refactor**
  - *Details*: Performed a comprehensive audit and refactor of the entire Flutter application to ensure 100% visual coherence with the selected Accent Color. Replaced all hardcoded "Success Green" (0xFF10B981) and "Productivity Purple" (0xFF8B5CF6) with dynamic `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary`.
  - *Tech Notes*: 
    - Updated `HabitCalendarWidget` to use a dynamic HSL hue calculation for the completion gradient.
    - Standardized chart colors in `GlobalTrendTabWidget`, `HabitMoodTabWidget`, `GlobalMoodTabWidget`, and `MacroGoalsStatsView`.
    - Refactored stat cards and badges in `InfoTabWidget`, `DayDetailsModal`, and `HabitOverviewTabWidget`.
    - Updated modal actions and borders in `HabitManagementModal`.

- [2026-04-27 11:30]: **Chart Timeframe Selectors Coherence**
  - *Details*: Updated the timeframe selectors in the statistics charts to use the accent color for the selected state instead of neutral muted colors.

  - *Details*: Integrated the global accent color into the `_SmoothAreaChartPainter` for the Global Trend view.

- [2026-04-27 11:00]: **Global Accent Color Implementation**

- [2026-05-07 10:45]: **Dynamic User Greeting and Profile Avatar**
  - *Details*: Updated the dashboard AppBar to dynamically display the user's first name and profile picture from their Supabase profile. Previously, these were hardcoded to "Simone" and a static GitHub URL.

- [2026-05-07 11:30]: **Professional Light Mode (White Mode) Implementation**
  - *Details*: Implemented a comprehensive and professional White Mode (Light Mode) across the entire application. Designed a premium light palette (Slate/Zinc) and migrated all UI components to a theme-aware architecture using `ThemeExtension`.
  - *Tech Notes*:
    - Created `AppColorsExtension` in `theme.dart` to provide semantic color access (e.g., `context.appColors.background`).
    - Implemented `AppTheme.lightTheme` with refined typography (Google Fonts Inter) and a soft Slate palette.
    - Updated `main.dart` to support dynamic switching between `theme` and `darkTheme` based on `settingsProvider`.
    - Refactored high-visibility screens and widgets including `AppSettingsScreen`, `HomeScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `StatisticsScreen`, `MacroGoalsScreen`, `BottomNavBar`, and `HabitCalendarWidget`.

- [2026-05-13 08:05]: **Database View Integration for Habit Statistics**
  - *Details*: Optimized the habit statistics panel by using a Supabase view (`habit_stats`) to calculate metrics (streaks, rate) instead of doing it in memory.

    - Added `share_plus: ^13.1.0` dependency.
    - Added `_exportData` method in `privacy_settings_screen.dart`.
    - Gathered data from `settingsProvider`, `goalsProvider`, and `macroGoalsProvider`.
    - Used `XFile.fromData` and `Share.shareXFiles` to share the file.

  - *Details*: Fixed an issue where the text of the "Conferma" button was invisible (white on white) during the "Reset Dati" flow.
  - *Tech Notes*: Added a check for the luminance of the primary color to determine whether to use black or white text for the non-destructive action button.

- [2026-05-13 19:36]: **Implementation of Full Data Reset (Local & Cloud)**
  - *Details*: Fixed an issue where "Resetta i Dati" only deleted data in Supabase but not in the local state. Now it clears local state and cache for goals, logs, macro goals, and resets settings to defaults.
  - *Tech Notes*:
    - Added `clearAll()` to `GoalsNotifier` and `HabitLogsNotifier` in `goal_provider.dart`.
    - Added `clearAll()` to `MacroGoalsNotifier` in `macro_goals_provider.dart`.
    - Added `resetToDefaults()` to `AppSettingsNotifier` in `settings_provider.dart`.
    - Called these methods in `_resetData` in `privacy_settings_screen.dart`.

## Current Status
- **Next Step**: Waiting for user feedback on the full data reset feature.
