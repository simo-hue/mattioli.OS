- [ ] Widget for iPhone & MacOS
- [ ] what happens if I modify manually an automatic habits?
- [ ] Different habits & goals types, not only checkboxes like status,progress bar
- [ ] For the desktop implementation what has been done with ollama is outstanding and I want to replicate the same thing also with LMStudio so the major local LLM providers are supported

/grill-me we are working on the mobile and desktop flutter implementations. I've activated the iCloud sync but I saw that not everything is being synchronized, an example are the Goals. Is there anything else that's missing? As I want to save all the important things there not only a part. My case is that I've imported the goals ( in privacy mode ) but they haven't sync.

## prompt

/grill-me we are working inside the flutter implementations on both desktop and mobile versions. What I was thinking about was to Add the "mixture" of habits to make it one ( for example 10 mins of workout OR 10000 steps ). Could exclusive ( OR ) or inclusive ( AND ). What do you think? How we can implement it in the most professional and user friendly way?

## prompt

/grill-me I was thinking about making some updates to the goals and habits. Right now in the flutter implementations, both desktop and mobile are only checkbox marked as pending, completed, failed. What I was thinking is to add a different type like habits or goals that aren't boolean but for example needs to be done more times. For example a push up daily habits that I want to do 20 push ups for four time a day and right now I have to create four different habit for each push up session, but what I would love to reach is to have the single "push up" habit that I can click on it and see the advancement of the habit to reach the 100% ( full completion ) only when I've completed all the steps.

This was only a single idea of new type but I want you to propose me something even more useful and cooler.

/grill-me  The current desktop AI coach implementation is almost perfect: 

* privacy mode: the user needs his own open router's API KEY;
* standard mode ( user connected with supabase ) uses my API KEY so the user doesn't need to care about that. The thing that needs to be implemented is that the user must have the pro subscription to access to the AI Coach. And in addition to that I see that inside the desktop app the paywall is not implemented  ( or at least it seems as when the pop up came out and I clicked on the button to see the plans it has redirected me to the settings in the profile page ). successfully ( as the mobile, where is fully working and professional ).

The mobile implementation is different ( and it's a problem ) as I want the implementations to be coherent as they are reppresenting the same app.

The mobile has already the paywall configured perfectly but the problem is the fact that the AI coach is accessible even from non pro users and it's a problem I want you to fix.

# TO DOUBLE CHECK:

/grill-me We are working on the flutter implementation, so both desktop and mobile. And as we have connected the screen time option for the auto-verifiable habits, I want you to ask this question as obviously I set a timer of 10 minutes for example on a specific app but what I was thinking about as it's obviously true at the beginning of the day. The problem is that how is handled the fact that the number obviously increases during the day? Is the habits checked every time? Or whenever it gets it first state then it's fixed and never checked again?
