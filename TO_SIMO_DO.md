# TO_SIMO_DO.md
- [ ] Widget for iPhone & MacOS
- [ ] what happens if I modify manually an automatic habits?
- [ ] Macro goals still need a numeric target + progress bar (status already cycles active/completed/failed). Habits are DONE — the Checkbox / Number / Automatic picker and quantitative targets are live; MacroTargetsConfig.enabled is still false on both apps.

## prompt to run 2
/grill-me We are working on the flutter implementation, so both desktop and mobile. And as we have connected the screen time option for the auto-verifiable habits, I want you to ask this question as obviously I set a timer of 10 minutes for example on a specific app but what I was thinking about as it's obviously true at the beginning of the day. The problem is that how is handled the fact that the number obviously increases during the day? Is the habits checked every time? Or whenever it gets it first state then it's fixed and never checked again?

## Cumulative numeric macro goals (feature #6) — foundation (2026-07-24)

### Deferred feature work (the macro-goal feature is NOT user-visible until these land)
- [ ] **UI (the bulk of remaining work)**: create/edit a numeric macro-goal target
      (amount + unit) + an optional "link a habit" picker + a progress bar, on both
      apps, gated by the flags. Mobile: `macro_goals_screen.dart` + `ui/widgets/macro_goals/`.
      Desktop: `create_goal_dialog.dart` + goals presentation. Will add the 5-locale
      i18n keys (+ Arabic native review).
- [ ] **Cloud-mode delete-snapshot**: in account mode, deleting a linked habit
      un-links the macro goal (ON DELETE SET NULL) but does NOT snapshot the
      accumulated derived value into progress_amount — implement a client
      fetch-sum-before-delete in `goal_provider.dart` (mobile) / `dashboard_controller.dart`
      (desktop) / cloud repo. (Private mode already snapshots.)
- [ ] **When the UI ships**: force-write the numeric columns on the Supabase UPDATE
      path (like the habit `target` column) so editing can actively CLEAR a target
      or break a link (today's conditional emit can't clear an omitted column).
- [ ] `get_macro_goals_stats` RPC + Dart twins unchanged (correct as-is — numeric
      completion flows through `status`); reflecting numeric progress in stats is a
      future enhancement, not a fix.

## Settings state hoist + pane split (2026-07-28)

- **Two timing nuances the widget suite cannot see.** The form state now lives in a keep-alive Riverpod controller rather than a per-mount `State`, which changes two things on a real machine: (1) the synced read-back applies one microtask after `initState` instead of inside it, so there is at most one frame of pre-hydration values when Settings opens; (2) the controller survives closing Settings, so re-opening re-arms the hydration latch and re-reads the appearance instead of rebuilding from SharedPreferences. Open Settings, change a preference on the iPhone, then close and re-open Settings on the Mac and confirm the Mac shows the iPhone's value.
- **Pre-existing, not introduced:** `settings_page.dart` `_deletePrivateData` opens its loading dialog after an `await` with no `mounted` check. If the page is disposed while the confirm dialog is open, it uses a defunct context. Worth fixing, but it is not a regression from this work.

## Screen Time on-device test checklist (2026-07-28)

Code audit of the Screen Time verification stack found 5 blockers to fix **before**
installing a test build (see the session report). These are the tests only a real
iPhone can settle, ordered by how much they change:

- **T1 — does re-registering reset the day's counter?** (Now also the acceptance test for the monitoring diff: with the diff in place an unchanged goal should NOT be re-registered at all, so its counter should survive a relaunch. Verify via `screen_time_monitor_specs` in the App Group — an unchanged goal must still have an entry after a sync that touched a different goal.)
  Original steps: Register a 5-min limit, burn 6 min so the threshold fires, force-quit, relaunch, background→foreground (this forces `stopMonitoring()` + re-register), burn 6 more min. *If the counter restarts at zero*, every app launch forgives the day's accumulated usage and `atMost` habits become unreachable — the whole sync strategy has to change from "stop everything and re-add" to a diff against `DeviceActivityCenter().activities`. Highest-value test.
- **T2 — does `stopMonitoring()` deliver `intervalDidEnd`?** With monitoring live mid-day, edit a threshold so the sync runs, then check the App Group buffer (`group.com.simo.evolve.verification`, key `pending_screen_time_signals`) for any `stayedUnder` row. **Assert on the row's `y`/`m`/`d` fields, not on "today"** — signals are now dated by the interval they describe, so a stop-induced row would carry neither today nor yesterday but be dropped entirely by the mid-day guard. Seeing *no* row is the pass. Seeing one means the guard's window needs widening.
  Also test the **23:55–23:59 band specifically**: edit a threshold in that window. If `stopMonitoring()` raises `intervalDidEnd`, a sync there is classified as "today's interval closing" and banks a spurious *pass* for today — the one five-minute hole the mid-day drop guard cannot cover.
- **T3 — what does the appex actually link?** After archiving: `otool -L …/PlugIns/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.appex/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension`. Expect system frameworks only. Any `@rpath/Flutter.framework` or `@rpath/SQLCipher.framework` confirms the extension is inheriting the app's Pods xcconfig and will likely be jetsammed at its 6 MB cap.
- **T4 — midnight attribution.** PRECONDITION: after the first sync, confirm the App Group key `screen_time_monitor_thresholds` actually holds `{goalId: minutes}`. Without it the extension takes the no-correction fallback and this test proves nothing. Then cross a limit at ~23:58 with the app closed and check which day the verdict lands on — it should be the day you crossed it, not the fresh one. A late `reachedThreshold` stamped on the fresh day is made *unflippable* by the permanence guard.
- **T4b — DST fall-back.** Set the date to a DST fall-back Sunday, register a 150-minute limit and burn usage across the repeated 01:00–02:00 hour. The crossing must land on that day. This is the case where wall-clock arithmetic silently mis-dates and only elapsed-time arithmetic is correct.
- **T5 — web-only picks.** In the picker select only websites and tap Done. Currently the app reports that as "empty" and refuses to save, even though native monitoring does handle web domains.
- **T6 — concurrent appends.** With 2+ Screen Time habits, check the App Group buffer after 23:59: expect one entry per goal. Missing entries confirm the unsynchronised read-modify-write race.
- **T7 — revoke and return.** Revoke Screen Time for Evolve in iOS Settings, reopen the app, and note where the FamilyControls toggle actually lives and what `authorizationStatus` reports. The in-app "Open Settings" button currently opens Settings › Evolve, not the Screen Time pane its own copy describes.
- **T9 — power-off overnight replay.** Let the phone die before 23:59 (charge to ~5% in the evening) and boot it in the morning. Does DeviceActivity replay the missed `intervalDidEnd`? If it does, that delivery is hours late but is a *genuine* report of yesterday — and the extension currently DROPS anything more than four hours after midnight. A replayed row appearing in the buffer means `lateDeliveryWindowMinutes` is discarding real passes and must be widened.
- **T10 — spring-forward.** Set the date to a spring-forward Sunday and let 23:59 pass. The App Group buffer must gain a `stayedUnder` row. This is the mirror of T4b: the day is 23 hours long, and any logic that measures the interval end in *elapsed* rather than *wall-clock* minutes silently drops every goal's pass that day.

- **T8 — notification permission.** The extension's real-time "limit reached" push is the feature's headline output, but the habit-editor path never requests notification permission. Confirm whether you get the banner without first visiting Settings › Screen Time.
